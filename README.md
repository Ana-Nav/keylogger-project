# Keylogger Project
Simple keylogger for Linux that logs keystrokes on a file, sends the log file and then deletes it.

Keylogger stops after pressing the Esc key. After the keylogger stops, the file will be sent to the provided email address and then deleted. Keys like Ctrl and Shift will be logged when they are both pressed and released to improve readability when logging certain key combinations, like Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Alt+T.

Example output:

* Ctrl+V being pressed:
